## IIT Bombay Edtech Internship

### Image Captioning

In this internship, we aimed to solve the problem of generating accurate and meaningful textual descriptions for images, a task known as image captioning. This is an important problem as it enhances accessibility for visually impaired individuals, improves content management, and aids in efficient image search. The challenge lies in bridging the gap between visual understanding and language generation, which requires sophisticated models capable of capturing and interpreting complex visual information and translating it into coherent text.
